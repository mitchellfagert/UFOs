# UFOs Sighting

## Overview of the analysis

There is a growing body of evidence that suggests UFOs are real, and that they represent some sort of unknown aircraft. Some people believe that these objects are spacecraft from other worlds, while others think they may be some sort of advanced aircraft developed by humans in the future.

We have been tasked to help **Dana** with building a webpage in which others can access information of reported sightings and see for themselves. This webpage should include:

    - A description or summary of the topic
    - A table that displays all of the information regarding reported UFO sightings/incidents
    - Search filters that will allow visitors to update the table based on the search criteria they enter

## Results

Below is a screenshot of the webpage that has been created. Upon entering, visitors will see:

At the bottom left side of the webpage they will notice a **"Filter Search"** section which has been added to help the visitor explored the data collected regarding UFO sightings.

The visitor can filter by one or all of the search criteria shown. Forn example, if you search by **"City"**, you will see that the table will update to show all the reported sightings within the data base that was recorded with that specific city.

Below is another example showing the use of two filter simultaneously. Note that for each individual search the table will update accordingly.

## Summary

Although this is a great tool for all visitors to discover recorded UFO sightings, there are some **drawbacks**.

They include:

    - The search field is "case-sensitive". The table will not update if you do not enter exactly how the data is stored and does not allow for partial entries. This is an issue because it does not intuitively tell the user how the information should be entered.

    -There is no button to click, wording or action that tells the user that the table will update after you hit "enter".

**Recommendations for further development:**

With the following enhancements listed below, this website can greatly improve the user's experience.

    - Add additional customizations, such as click-buttons, dropdown list, and/or auto-fill that can help "guide" the user and make the web page more interactive.

    - Add a "Latest News" section that will highlight an article showing the most recent reported sighting.
